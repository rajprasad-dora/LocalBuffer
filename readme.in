LocalBuffer high level idea:
Phase-1
    1) File read from client and write to server (Done)
    2) Read the fileName and write to server with the same fileName
    3) Read from server and write to Client with the same fileName
    4) Decide who has the latest file in the network and update the outdated peer on the network.
    5) Instead for client/server implement a common n/w connection handler.

Phase-2
    1) Peers registration contract.
    2) Auto detection of the registered peers.
    3) Scale to handle multiple peers and Algo/Contract for multiple auto sync b/w multiple peers.
